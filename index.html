    <h1>F.A.Q.</h1>
    <p>No that anyone ever stopped me in the street to ask me those but since you're here, I thought you might be
      wondering.</p>

    <h2>Who are you?</h2>
    <p>A deeply philosophical question if you really think about it, but let's keep it casual until we know each other
      better.</p>
    <p>My name is Emilien Durieu, I'm a 29 year old nerd who enjoys programming either to make people's life easier,
      or
      more fun. I'm fluent in French, English and Javascript.
      What I enjoy most is crafting custom web applications.
      I like good food, travelling and oh wait this isn't Tinder, sorry.
    </p>
    <p>Anyway if you wanna get in touch, don't hesitate to send me an email
      to
      <a
        href="mailto:hello@emilienduri.eu?subject=I%20have%20a%20problem%20that%20I%20think%20can%20be%20solved%20by%20a%20programmer">hello@emilienduri.eu</a>.
      Maybe we can also go for a beer or something.

    <h2>I'm looking for a developper for my company/startup/project, are you interested?</h2>
    <p>I am very interested, don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:hello@emilienduri.eu?subject=">reach out</a>! I'm a
      full
      stack developper, mainly React and NodeJS but I've learned new languages and frameworks before and I'm willing
      to do it again if the project is interesting.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>I need a website, can you help?</h2>
    <p>I certainly can. If you need a webshop or a blog, or even a simple website for your business or association, I
      can set everything up for you. <a href="mailto:hello@emilienduri.eu?subject=Put%20me%20on%20the%20Internet">Just
        Ask!</a></p>

  <section>
    <h2>What else can you do for me?</h2>
    <p>I cook a terrific chili sin carne that makes delicious burritos, but I guess that's not what you mean.</p>
    <p>If you have any task that is very repetitive, there's a good chance I can help you automate it. If you're using
      excel and are tired of it or reaching its limits, <a
        href="mailto:hello@emilienduri.eu?subject=Bloody%20Exc-hell">send me an email</a> and let's talk about it;
      life
      is too short for pivot tables.</p>
